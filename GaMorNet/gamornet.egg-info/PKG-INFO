        Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet)
        =====================================
        
        GaMorNet is a Convolutional Neural Network based on AlexNet to classify galaxies morphologically. GaMorNet does not need a large amount of training data (as it is trained on simulations and then transfer-learned on a small portion of real data) and can be applied on multiple datasets. Till now, GaMorNet has been tested on ~100,000 SDSS g-band galaxies and ~20,000 CANDELS H-band galaxies and has a misclassification rate of <5%. 
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Please read the `detailed documentation <https://gamornet.readthedocs.io/>`_ in order to start using GaMorNet
        
        
        Publication & Other Data
        ------------------------
        You can look at this `ApJ paper <https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab8a47>`_ to learn the details about GaMorNet's architecture, how it was trained, and other details not mentioned in the documentation. 
        
        We strongly suggest you read the above-mentioned publication if you are going to use our trained models for performing predictions or as the starting point for training your own models.
        
        All the different elements of the public data release (including the new Keras models) are summarized in the `PDR Usage Guide <https://gamornet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_guide.html>`_
